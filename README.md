Hello this is my personal site, 

    The purpose of this site, is to sort of track different stages of my life, in one place so i can always get back to and see whether or not I have made any progess in whatever I have set out to acheive. I want to look back 10years from now and see that I have made progress no matter how little it maybe. 

Thanks For checking this out, lol

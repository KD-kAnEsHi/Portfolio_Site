Hello this is my personal site, 

    The purpose of this site, is to sort of track different stages of my life, in one place so i can always get back to and see whether or not I have made any progess in whatever I have set out to acheive. I want to look back 10years from now and see that I have made progress no matter how little it maybe. 

Thanks For checking this out, lol

v2 - Is going to have to the serves build using node.js and stored data in the database (Learning these tools at the moment). In order to make sure changes in HabiTracker will appear to every user, and not just the users local device. 
   - More featurees, too but I have some more import projects at the moments
